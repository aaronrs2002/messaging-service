test: Good morning.

georgia: How are you?

test: Great! Now that I have a messaging service that works on any computer or device with no contract.

georgia: No contract? Then who's running the service?

test: It's just a react web app installed on any server. This one happens to be on a free cloud sever I started with an email account.

georgia: So, it's a messaging app that works from any computer or phone with no records or contracts with anyone.

test: Yup, just an open source JavaScript web app. It takes up almost zero space since all messages are deleted permanantly by the users.
